The Simulation Engine (SimEng) is a framework for building modern cycle-accurate processor simulators. It aims to be:

- Fast
- Easy to use and modify to desired configurations
- Scalable, supporting simulation of simple scalar cores, up to superscalar out-of-order designs
- Capable of supporting a wide range of ISAs, starting with ARMv8 but eventually including x86, RISC-V, POWER, etc.
- Open source, with a permissive license to enable collaboration across academia and industry

SimEng places an emphasis on performance and scalability, whilst maintaining a clean, modern, and well-documented code base.


Current Support
---------------

Currently, SimEng targets the ARMv8+SVE ISA with the ability to model up to out-of-order, superscalar, single-core processors and to emulate a subset of Linux system-calls. It supports statically compiled C binaries that run on real hardware and models memory as an infinite L1 cache.

The main component provided by the simulator is a discrete processor core model, (the generic model is shown below), which accepts a clock signal and supports a memory access interface. A YAML format configuration file can be passed to the simulation to modify the core model, for instance to model other current or future core designs. Current SimEng configurations support Marvell ThunderX2 and Fujitsu A64FX processors.

As soon as SimEng is mature enough, we plan to support multi-core and memory hierarchy simulation by integrating SimEng with the `Structural Simulation Toolkit <http://sst-simulator.org/>`_ (SST). So far we have implemented a prototype of SSTâ€™s memory hierarchy integration.


Talks and presentations
-----------------------

SimEng was presented by `Professor Simon McIntosh-Smith <http://uob-hpc.github.io/SimonMS/>`_ at the 2019 Workshop on Modeling & Simulation of Systems and Applications (ModSim):

Release
-------

SimEng is planned for open-source release during summer 2021 under an `Apache 2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ license.
