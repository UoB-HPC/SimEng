AArch64
=======

SimEng provides a basic implementation of the 64-bit AArch64 architecture---part of the ARMv8-a ISA. This implementation provides support for decoding and executing a range of common instructions, sufficient to run a number of simple benchmarks. It is also capable of handling supervisor call (syscall) exception via basic system call emulation, allowing the execution of programs that have been statically compiled with the standard library.

Decoding
--------

Instruction decoding is performed using the `Capstone <https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/>` disassembly framework. The disassembly generated by Capstone is used to determine the properties, operands, and execution behaviour of the corresponding instruction.

Adding instructions
-------------------

Due to the vast number of AArch64 instruction variants, instructions are only added to this architecture as encountered in programs using them; as a result, to run a new program it will likely be necessary to add support for a number of instructions.

.. Note:: When adding support for new instructions, it's recommended to run SimEng in emulation mode for both speed, and for an execution flow that's easier to follow.

When you first run the new program through SimEng, execution will occur as normal until an unsupported instruction reaches the retirement point. This will then generate an illegal instruction exception, which the architecture will catch and provide useful output before terminating. An example of the expected output is below::

  Encountered execution not-yet-implemented exception
    Generated by instruction:
      0x00000000004004a8: f3 0f 1e f8     str x19, [sp, #-0x20]!
        opcode ID: 1920
  Halting due to fatal exception

This information includes the program address of the unrecognised instruction, the bytes of the encoded instruction, and the textual representation of the instruction. An "opcode ID" is also provided: this corresponds to a specific value in the ``simeng::arch::aarch64::Opcode`` namespace, imported from Capstone.

Adding execution behaviour
**************************

The first step to add a new instruction (and the only, for many instructions) is to add a new entry into the execution behaviour table found in ``src/lib/arch/aarch64/Instruction_execute.cc``. These entries are responsible for reading the input operands and generating one or more results which may be read by the model handling the instruction. The entry should be uniquely identified by the namespace entry corresponding to the opcode ID presented by SimEng when the unsupported instruction was encountered.

There are several useful variables that execution behaviours have access to:

``operands``
  This is a vector of ``RegisterValue``, with each value corresponding to one of the input operands. For most instructions, ``operands[0]`` will be the *second* operand as written textually, as the first operand is typically the destination register. E.g., for the instruction ``add w0, w1, w2``, ``operands[0]`` will correspond to ``w1`` and ``[1]`` to ``w2``.
  
  Some instructions have "implicit" register reads: these are added to the **start** of the operand array. E.g., the instruction ``b.ne #16`` implicitly reads the "NZCV" flags. In this case, ``operands[0]`` will be the value of the flag register. 
  
  Some instructions have operands to which they both read and write, such as ``fmla v0.d, v1.d, v2.d`` both writing to *and* reading from ``v0.d``; in this case, ``operands[0]`` is ``v0.d``, and ``[1]`` and ``[2]`` are ``v1.d`` and ``v2.d`` respectively.

  Instructions such as stores may not have any destination registers at all. In these cases, the ``operand`` indices match the positions as they appear: the first operand is ``[0]``, the second ``[1]``, and so on.
  
``results``
  This is the output vector, into which ``RegisterValue`` instances containing the results should be placed. Each entry in the vector corresponds to a destination register.

  Some instructions have "implicit" destination registers: in these cases, the implicit destinations are added to the start of the results vector. For example, ``subs w0, w1, #1`` writes explicitly to ``w0``, but also implicitly sets the "NZCV" comparison flags. In this case, ``results[0]`` is expected to be the updated NZCV flags, while ``results[1]`` is expected to be the new value of ``w0``.

  Memory instructions may have a "writeback" variant, where the register containing the address is updated by an offset during execution. In these cases, the address register is added as a destination *after* the other registers, corresponding with the textual representation of the registers. E.g., the instruction ``ldr x1, [x2, #8]!`` will expect the value of ``x1`` in ``results[0]``, while the updated address ``x2`` should be placed in ``results[1]``.

``metadata``
  Each instruction stores a simplified form of the full disassembly metadata generated by Capstone. This is stored in the ``metadata`` member variable, and is of type ``InstructionMetadata``. The metadata object contains an ``metadata.operands`` array with entries corresponding to the textual operands of the instruction. **Note:** Unlike the instruction's ``operands`` member variable, ``metadata.operands`` entries correspond directly to their textual equivalent. For example, in the instruction ``add w0, w1, w2``, ``metadata.operands[0]`` will describe ``w0``, ``[1]`` describes ``w1``, and so on.
  
  The primary use for this data is to retrieve immediate values. For example, with the instruction ``add w0, w1, #1``, ``metadata.operands[2].imm`` would contain the value ``1``. Floating-point immediates are similarly available, using ``.fp`` in place of ``.imm``.

  For memory operations, the *entire* memory address section is treated as a single ``metadata.operands`` entry, with information available under ``metadata.operands[n].mem``. For example, for the instruction ``ldr x0, [sp, #8]``, ``metadata.operands[1].mem`` contains information on the ``[sp, #8]`` block, with ``metadata.operands[1].mem.disp`` containing the specified offset of ``8``.


cstool
''''''

Capstone provides a ``cstool`` utility, which provides a visual representation of the ``metadata`` information available for any given instruction. For example, feeding it the bytes for the ``str`` instruction displayed above results in the following::

    $ cstool -d arm64 f30f1ef8
     0  f3 0f 1e f8  str    x19, [sp, #-0x20]!
            op_count: 2
                    operands[0].type: REG = x19
                    operands[0].access: READ
                    operands[1].type: MEM
                            operands[1].mem.base: REG = sp
                            operands[1].mem.disp: 0xffffffe0
                    operands[1].access: READ | WRITE
            Write-back: True
            Registers read: x19 sp
            Registers modified: sp

Zero registers
**************

AArch64 provides two zero registers, ``WZR`` and ``XZR``, which are always read as 0. This implementation mirrors that behaviour, and will automatically populate the relevant ``operands`` entry with a 0-value ``RegisterValue``.

For instructions that are capable of generating multiple results (typically flag-setting instructions) it's possible for them to claim to write to one of the zero registers: in these cases, the result is discarded. This implementation supports this behaviour, and reduces the number of available ``results`` entries accordingly.

Loads and stores
****************

In addition to an execution behaviour, memory instructions also require a new entry in the address generation behaviour table found in ``src/lib/arch/aarch64/Instruction_address.cc``. These entries are responsible for describing the method used to generate the addresses that these instructions will read from or write to.

Address generation is expected to generate one or more instances of ``MemoryAddressTarget``, containing an address and the number of bytes to access. The same variables described above (``operands``, ``metadata``) are available to use to generate these addresses.

Once the addresses have been generated, they should be supplied in an initialiser list to the ``setMemoryAddresses`` helper function.


Instruction aliases
*******************

As Capstone is primarily a disassembler, it will attempt to generate the correct aliases for instructions: for example, the ``cmp w0, #0`` instruction is an alias for ``subs wzr, w0, #0``. As it's the underlying instruction that is of use (in this case, the ``subs`` instruction), this implementation includes a de-aliasing component that reverses this conversion. The logic for this may be found in ``src/lib/arch/aarch64/InstructionMetadata``.

If a known but unsupported alias is encountered, it will generate an invalid instruction error, and the output will identify the instruction as unknown in place of the usual textual representation. It is recommended to reference a disassembled version of the program to identify what the instruction at this address should be correctly disassembled to, and implement the necessary dealiasing logic accordingly.
