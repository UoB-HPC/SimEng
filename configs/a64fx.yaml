## PORTS
# Each port describes which instruction types can be issued from it and 
# is configured as a set of instruction groups. An instruction group can 
# be defined as a set of instruction identifiers with the available 
# options of:
# - ARITHMETIC (Default assignment)
# - SHIFT (Instructions containing shifted operands)
# - MULTIPLY (Instructions containing a multiply operand)
# - DIVIDE (Instructions containing a divide or sqrt operand)
# - ASIMD (Floating Point, NEON, and SVE instructions)
# - LOAD (Load instructions)
# - STORE (Store instructions)
# - BRANCH (Branch instructions)
# - PREDICATE (Instructions that write to predicate registers)
#
# An instruction group is comprised of COMPULSORY identifiers (which an 
# instruction must belong to) and OPTIONAL identifiers (which an 
# instruction may belong to). The below example defines the instruction 
# group describing floating-point multiply and divide operations:
#
# Compulsory:
#   - ASIMD
# Optional:
#   - MULTIPLY
#   - DIVIDE
#
## EXECUTION PIPELINE RELATIONS
# Ports and Execution-Unit list entries are numbered in chronological 
# order with each list entry mapping to the other (i.e. Ports[0] maps to 
# Execution-Unit[0]). A Reservation-Stations entry contains a Ports list 
# which utilises the Ports numbering scheme to map ports to reservation 
# stations.
#
## BLOCKING GROUPS
# A Blocking-Group defines an instruction identifier which is 
# operation-stalled. The term operation-stalled denotes the stalling of 
# a specific operation type into an execution unit during the execution of 
# a similar operation (akin to pipeline stalling but for a specific 
# operation type). The NONE instruction identifier is used to denote no 
# operation-stalling.
