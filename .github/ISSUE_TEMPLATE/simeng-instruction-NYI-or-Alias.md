**Check List**
 [ ] I have selected the appropriate title prefix from the available options within `[NYI|ALIAS|SYSREG]`, and added a suitable title after this.
 [ ] The binary I am trying to run has been compiled statically for either RV64 or AArch64.
 [ ] The compiled binary is a Linux Elf file.

**Binary Compilation Instructions**
Provide a bullet list of how the binary in question was compiled, including all compiler flags used.

**SimEng CMAKE Options Used**
Provide a bullet list of all CMAKE options used. E.g. `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.

**SimEng Command Line Expression**
Provide the comman line expression used to run SimEng e.g. `./simeng /path/to/configs/a64fx.yaml /path/to/myBinary.elf`

**Console Printout**
Please provide a console printout of all SimEng output prior to the execution statistics. Please do not include any binary specific output.
E.g.
```bash
./simeng configs/a64fx.yaml myStaticBinary.elf
