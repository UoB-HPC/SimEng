# SimEng

The Simulation Engine framework (SimEng) provides a modern cycle-accurate processor simulator, with aims to be:

- Fast
- Easy to use and modify to desired configurations
- Scalable, supporting simulation of simple scalar cores, up to superscalar out-of-order designs
- Capable of supporting a wide range of ISAs, starting with ARMv8 but eventually including x86, RISC-V, POWER, etc.
- Open source, with a permissive license to enable collaboration across academia and industry


The purpose of SimEng is to provide an alternative to the existing industry standard, gem5, by placing an emphasis on performance and scalability from the start, and maintaining a clean, modern, and well-documented code base.

## Getting started with SimEng

To get started with SimEng, please follow the instructions set out in our [User Documentation](https://uob-hpc.github.io/SimEng-Docs/users/index.html). This will cover how to download, build and run SimEng along with a brief overview on how it works.

If you are interested in developing further SimEng features, and are already familiar with the User Documentation please refer to our [Developer Documentation](https://uob-hpc.github.io/SimEng-Docs/developers.html). This offers further depth on how SimEng works and why design decisions that have been made.
